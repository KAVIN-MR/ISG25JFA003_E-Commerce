# Remake Current Order Component Plan

## Information Gathered
- **Current Layout**: Two-column layout with order items on left and summary sidebar on right.
- **Order Model**: Has id, status, totalAmount, orderItems (with productName, price, quantity), addressId, paymentMethodId, placed_at.
- **Required Changes**: One big card containing all order items with images, shipping address, payment method, estimated shipping date, arrival details, cancel order/payment buttons.
- **Product Images**: Currently using getProductImage mapping; user mentioned "product URL" - assuming productUrl field or using existing method.
- **Missing Fields**: Estimated shipping date, arrival details not in model - will add mock data or assume fields.

## Plan
- Update `current-order.component.html` to single big card layout with sections for items, shipping/payment info, dates, and actions.
- Update `current-order.component.scss` for the new layout, maintaining glassmorphism and colors.
- Update `current-order.component.ts` to add cancel methods and handle dates (mock if needed).

## Dependent Files to Edit
- `Frontend/src/app/features/orders/components/current-order.component.html`
- `Frontend/src/app/features/orders/components/current-order.component.scss`
- `Frontend/src/app/features/orders/components/current-order.component.ts`

## Followup Steps
- Test the component for layout, responsiveness, and functionality.
- Ensure images load correctly and buttons work.
